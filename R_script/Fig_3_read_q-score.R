######################################################################################################################
# Date of creation: 2025-07-15

# ================================================================================================
# Data availability:
# - Raw sequencing data are not included in this repository due to large file sizes.  
# - Data can be downloaded from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under accession number [PRJNA1332407].
# ================================================================================================

# ================================================================================================
# Working directory:
# - Ensure that the "Q-mean" folder exists in your current working directory.
# - All FASTQ/FASTQ.GZ files for quality assessment should be placed inside "Q-mean" or its subfolders.
# - For more details, please refer to the README file.

# Fig 3. Distribution of Mean Q-scores
# ================================================================================================
# This script calculates and visualizes the distribution of mean Q-scores from raw FASTQ files
# generated during 16S rRNA sequencing.
#
# Workflow:
#   1. Recursively search the base directory ("Q-mean") for FASTQ/FASTQ.GZ files.
#   2. For each file, extract quality scores using ShortRead.
#   3. Compute mean Q-scores per read and organize results into a combined dataset.
#   4. Generate density plots of mean Q-score distributions for each crop group.
#   5. Save the plot as a high-resolution PNG file for publication use.
#
# Key Notes:
#   - Input: FASTQ files (compressed or uncompressed) stored in subfolders by crop.
#   - Output: "mean_qscore_all_reads.png" (28 x 20.2 cm, 600 dpi).
#   - X-axis: Mean Q-score per read (range 1â€“40).
#   - Y-axis: Density (proportion of reads).
#   - Fill color: Crop-specific grouping (folder name).
#   - Interpretation: Provides an overview of sequencing read quality across experimental groups.
